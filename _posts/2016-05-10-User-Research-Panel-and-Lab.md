***Summary:*** Recruiting participants is one of the most challenging aspects of UX research. 

As the sole user experience researcher, I operate with a limited budget at a limited capacity. The auto finance industry is also highly regulated which compounds the difficulty of doing accurate and efficient research. To resolve this, I have developed a portable usability lab for doing usability testing and interviews and developing a proprietary user research panel to supplement my recruiting needs. 


Methods
-------

I set up onsite visits to [Usability Sciences](http://www.usabilitysciences.com/) and [Sabre](https://www.sabre.com/) to tour professional usability labs to better understand the physical space, and gather opinions on the most important elements of a usability lab. 

After meeting with multiple departments internally, I devised a strategy for recruitment which involved creating a proprietary user research panel which would be implemented in three phases:

+ **Phase 1 - Internal Panel:** Starting with a panel of internal employees introduces the smallest amount of risk and functions as a sandbox for us to build the system and learn how to maintain, manage, and incentivize participants appropriately.

+ **Phase 2 -  B2B Panel:** Taking what we learned from the first phase, we would leverage special incentives and programs geared to our business relationships to build a Business to business (B2B) user research panel. This panel would be used to evaluate specific tools and extranets maintained created by our company for our B2B partners.

+ **Phase 3 - Customer Panel:** Being in a highly regulated industry means that a customer panel introduces the most risk for our organization. With the proper guidance and care we would take our learnings from the first two phases and apply to the customer panel. 

As the sole researcher, I needed to find a way to begin running usability tests as soon as possible. I created a presentation deck recapping what was learned from the usability lab visits, and outlined the recruitment strategy.  I also included a list of equipment needed to capture quality audio and video at a minimal cost and small enough to fit inside a carry-on suitcase. The presentation included a rough timeline and was shared with key stakeholders.

Results
-------

I procured the equipment for the portable usability lab immediately and began doing usability testing on a regular basis. The portable lab allows me to set up the equipment in any available conference room on campus. It also allows me to do off-site interviews at car dealerships or call centers locally or nationwide. 

I am actively working with the IT department to define technical requirements for the user research panel. It will feature a front-end web form for participants to opt in to the panel, and  back-end side for me to run queries to pull a specific number of participants who match specific criteria based on the research needs.

Conclusion
----------

Participant recruitment is one of the most difficult and time consuming tasks, but it is also critical to produce unbiased, representative, accurate results. To know this is one thing, but convincing an organization that it is critical to the success of our web products is certainly more difficult. It is a massive undertaking that requires time and persistence. Every conversation with a stakeholder is another opportunity to build a relationship and evangelize my research practice. Beyond just making user research easier to do, I think it should play a more prominent role not just in the evaluation of existing products, but also at a more strategic level helping inform the company on what products and features our customers need.
